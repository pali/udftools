.B udffsck
[\fB\-vvvcipCh\fR]
[\fB\-b\fR \fIBLOCKSIZE\fR]
.IR medium
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B udffsck
is used to check and correct UDF file systems.
There are known limitations regarding UDF version, which is now limited to 2.01 or older.
.PP
.I medium 
is the device file where file system is stored (e.g. 
.IR /dev/sda1 ).
.PP
Please note it is not safe run
.B udffsck

Even if you think it is safe to run it on mounted file system, whole report is invalid.
You should never never make any changes on mounted file system, so if
.B udffsck 
asks to do so, only valid answer is ,,no'', otherwise you can break your filesystem instead.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-b " " \fIBLOCKSIZE\fR
Force udffsck to use this blocksize instead of autodetection.
This value is in bytes.
Default is autodetected value by finding VRS and AVDP positions.
.TP
.BR \-c
Only check medium and print found errors.
This is default behavior.
.TP
.BR \-C
Coloring output with ASCII color code.
.TP
.BR \-i
Interactively fix medium.

.TP
.BR \-vv 
Message verbosity level.

Recomended for manual usage.
.TP
.BR \-vvv
Debug Verbosity level. 
Only for development and debug purposes. 
And for nosy users.

.B udffsck
is the sum of the following conditions:
.br
\       0\      \-\ No errors
.br
\       1\      \-\ File system errors corrected
.br
\       2\      \-\ File system errors corrected, system should

\       \       \ \ be rebooted (not used at this moment)
.br

.PP
.nf
.RS
udffsck -p udf_image_file.img
